2) Using the expression browser
Let us try looking at some data that Prometheus has collected about itself.
To use Prometheus's built-in expression browser, navigate to http://localhost:9090/graph and choose the "Table" view within the "Graph" tab.

As you can gather from http://localhost:9090/metrics,
one metric that Prometheus exports about itself is called promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total
 the total number of /metrics requests the Prometheus server has served). Go ahead and enter this into the expression console.
